- FOMO model for reading water level
[FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects)](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-studio/learning-blocks/object-detection/fomo-object-detection-for-constrained-devices)
is a novel machine learning algorithm that brings object detection to highly constrained devices. We will capture the picture of staff gauge and use the FOMO model to get
the height of the water level.

- Use the MQTT protocol to communicate between the Hardware and API server.
